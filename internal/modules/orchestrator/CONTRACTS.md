# Contracts: orchestrator

> **Module Name:** `orchestrator/` is the stable name of the Task Execution Workflow Engine.
> A future `director/` module may handle higher-level agent orchestration, but `orchestrator/` remains the workflow execution layer.

## Invariants

1. `RunTask` is the only public method of the workflow engine.
2. `RunTask` never accesses repositories directly; it uses only injected domain services.
3. Work units are executed in topological order (DAG dependency order).
4. Each work unit execution is isolated: its own Run, AgentSession, and Runtime instance.
5. If a work unit fails, the engine records the failure but continues with remaining independent work units in the first cut.
6. Every significant step emits an event via the EventStore.
7. Timeouts are enforced per work unit, not per task.
8. This module never mutates task, run, or session state directly; it delegates to the respective services.
9. This module does NOT decide which task to run or when — it only executes tasks that have already been scheduled.

## State Machine

```
RunTask called
  → task.fetched
  → graph.decomposed (if needed)
  → work_units.ordered
  → ForEach work_unit:
      → run.created
      → run.started
      → agent.found_or_created
      → session.created
      → session.connected
      → prompt.prepared
      → runtime.started
      → relay.running
      → [events routed]
      → run.completed | run.failed
      → triggers.evaluated
  → task.completed | task.partial | task.failed
```

## Execution Rules

- `RunTask` is the only public method — no direct repository access.
- Services are injected via interfaces; never import repositories from other modules.
- Work units are processed in topological order.
- Each work unit gets its own Run + AgentSession.
- Failures are recorded but do not halt the entire task unless all work units fail.
- Every significant step MUST emit an event.

---

## Boundary Rules

Allowed:
- Call injected service interfaces from all other modules.
- Emit events via `core/transition` helpers.

Forbidden:
- Direct repository imports from other modules.
- Inline SQL outside `queries.go`.
- Business logic beyond task orchestration and coordination.

High-level task execution workflow is the sole responsibility of this module.
Low-level cross-module transaction coordination belongs to the module that owns the aggregate root of the process (ADR-0028).

## Error Rules

| Code | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `CodeValidation` | Invalid options or input |
| `CodeInvalidInput` | Semantically invalid input |
| `CodeNotFound` | Task or dependency not found |
| `CodeExternal` | Runtime API failures |
| `CodePersistence` | Database errors |

---

## Persistence Rules

- SQL belongs only in `queries.go`.
- No business logic inside repositories — pure CRUD.
- Use `core/db.BeginTx` / `CommitTx` / `RollbackTx` for transactions.

## File Decomposition

### `service_<context>.go` Pattern

Cross-module coordination logic SHOULD be extracted into `service_<context>.go` files:
- `service.go` → Main `RunTask` workflow and core orchestration
- `service_cascade.go` → Cascade cancellation across runs and work units
- `service_prompt.go` → Prompt preparation coordination (fetch aggregates, compose, persist)
- `service_run_workunit_sync.go` → Run-to-workunit transition synchronization
- `service_relay.go` → Runtime event relay coordination (future)

This pattern keeps `service.go` focused while allowing the orchestrator to grow as the canonical cross-module layer.
